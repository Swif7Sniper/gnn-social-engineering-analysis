# Graph Neural Network (GNN) – Social Engineering Analysis

This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using TensorFlow to analyse relationships between social engineering variables.

## Overview
The model represents social engineering factors as nodes in a graph and learns structural patterns and dependencies from their relationships. Development and training were performed in Google Colab.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- NetworkX
- Google Colab

## Key Highlights
- Graph-based representation of social engineering variables
- Node feature engineering and model training
- Visualisation of graph structure and learned patterns
- Interpretation of model outputs for insight generation
